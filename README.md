# SDS2-ErasmusWebsite_Poznan
The project is a software development project that aims to support students participating in the Erasmus Exchange Program at PUT.
Our project is a web application called Courses for Erasmus Students (CES) and allows students to interact socially, share lessons learned about the courses, choose the best courses for their learning agreement, help in paper management and resolution of frequently asked questions that any Erasmus person has.

## Roles and responsabilies
-Iñaki Domínguez Imoberdorff (Scrum Master and Product Owner)
  As Product Owner (PO):
    ·Requirements definition: My primary responsibility as PO is to define and prioritize project requirements.
    ·Prioritization of the backlog: I maintain and prioritize the Product Backlog, an ordered list of work items that describe the functionality, features or tasks needed for the project. This involves determining what is most important and should be done first.
    ·Participation in Sprint Planning: During Sprint planning, I work with the Scrum Team to select the Product Backlog items to be included in the next Sprint and commit to providing clarity and detail on the Sprint objectives.
    ·Answering team questions: I am available to the Scrum team during the Sprint to answer questions, provide clarity on requirements, and ensure that the team has a proper understanding of what is being built.
    ·Deliverable Approval: At the end of each Sprint, I review and approve deliverables to ensure they meet the defined acceptance criteria.
    ·Value Assignment: I commit that the deliverable at the end of each sprint release has value to the customer.
  
  As Scrum Master (SM):
    ·Facilitating the Scrum process: My role as Scrum Master is to facilitate Scrum ceremonies, such as Sprint planning, Sprint review, and Sprint retrospective, to ensure that they are performed effectively as much as possible.
    ·Barrier removal: I work to remove obstacles or impediments that may hinder the team's progress, resolving issues and collaborating with others to ensure a smooth workflow.
    ·Team Support: I act as a constant support for the Scrum team, encouraging collaboration, self-organization, and continuous improvement. I ensure that the team follows Scrum principles and values.
    ·Metrics and continuous improvement: I help the team measure their performance and identify ways to improve, which includes conducting Sprint retrospectives and implementing process changes.
    ·Collaboration with the Product Owner: I work closely with the PO to ensure that the team has a clear understanding of the project requirements and goals.

  As Developers
  ·Feature development: My main responsibility as a developer is to create the features, components or solutions needed to meet the requirements of the project, as defined in the Product Backlog and selected for the Sprint.
  ·Self-organization: As part of the development team, we must be able to self-organize in order to plan and carry out our work effectively. This involves making decisions on how to approach tasks and assigning work among ourselves.
  ·Collaboration: I work closely with other members of the Scrum team, such as the Product Owner and Scrum Master, to ensure that we understand the requirements and objectives of the project and ensure effective communication within the team.
  ·Commitment to Delivery: We commit to meet Sprint objectives and deliver a potentially usable product increment at the end of each Sprint. We work constantly to achieve our commitments.
  ·Quality of Work: We are responsible for ensuring the quality of the work we do. This involves following sound software development practices, writing unit tests, and performing quality testing to ensure that the product is reliable and functional.
  ·Participation in Scrum ceremonies: We actively participate in Scrum meetings, such as Sprint planning, Sprint review, and Sprint retrospective. We provide feedback on progress and collaborate on continuous process improvement.
  ·Adherence to Scrum values and principles: We follow Scrum values and principles, which include commitment, transparency, inspection, and adaptation. We maintain an agile mindset and are willing to adapt to change.
  ·Continuous learning: We are willing to constantly learn and improve our skills and knowledge in software development. This includes keeping up to date with best practices and new technologies.

## Communication estrategies
Our main communications are: the private WhatsApp group, discord channel and in-person meetings. We usually hold at least one face-to-face meeting per week to update ourselves on how we are progressing and make future decisions. We use the WhatsApp group for any crucial questions that require more instant attention and it is available whenever needed. Finally, we use discord as a support measure in case we cannot all meet in person for some reason.
