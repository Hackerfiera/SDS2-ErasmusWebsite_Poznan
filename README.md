# SDS2-ErasmusWebsite_Poznan
The project is a software development project that aims to support students participating in the Erasmus Exchange Program at PUT.
Our project is a web application called Courses for Erasmus Students (CES) and allows students to interact socially, share lessons learned about the courses, choose the best courses for their learning agreement, help in paper management and resolution of frequently asked questions that any Erasmus person has.

## Communication estrategies
Our main communications are: the private WhatsApp group, discord channel and in-person meetings. We usually hold at least one face-to-face meeting per week to update ourselves on how we are progressing and make future decisions. We use the WhatsApp group for any crucial questions that require more instant attention and it is available whenever needed. Finally, we use discord as a support measure in case we cannot all meet in person for some reason.
